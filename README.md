## Hi, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Qoosim || Full-Stack-Developer

I am a full stack web developer with a passion for creating seamless and visually appealing user experience. Whether figuring out a difficult problem or crafting a beautiful user experience, as a Full Stack Developer, programming satisfies my desire for both constant learning and personal ongoing refinement. While I'm not coding, I love reading amazing books on psychology, learning a new language, or just researching on other languages. I am available for hire and ready to relocate or work remotely.
